✅ SELL A PET MODAL & MY LISTINGS - FIXES APPLIED
=================================================================

ISSUES FIXED:
=================================================================

1. ❌ PROBLEM: Sell a Pet popup not opening
   ✅ SOLUTION: Updated openModal() and closeModal() functions to handle 
                both old modal structure (.modal.show) and new modal 
                structure (.modal-overlay with hidden attribute)

2. ❌ PROBLEM: No demo listings in My Listings
   ✅ SOLUTION: Added automatic demo listing creation on first load
                Creates "Max" (Golden Retriever) as sample listing

=================================================================
CHANGES MADE:
