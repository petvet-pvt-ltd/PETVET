# Multi-Role Registration System - Complete ✅

## Overview
Implemented a complete multi-role registration system following MVC architecture with proper routing integration.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Database Connection Issue
**Problem:** `Fatal error: Class "Database" not found`
- **Cause:** RegistrationModel was using `Database::getInstance()->getConnection()` 
- **Fix:** Changed to use `db()` function from `config/connect.php`

### 2. ✅ Routing Integration
**Problem:** Registration wasn't using the MVC routing system
- **Before:** Direct file access at `/register/registration_process.php`
- **After:** Proper routing through `index.php?module=guest&page=register`
- **Benefits:**
  - Consistent with rest of application
  - Centralized authentication handling
  - Better security and maintenance

### 3. ✅ Authentication Guards
**Problem:** Guest pages accessible when logged in
- **Fix:** Added redirect logic to prevent logged-in users from accessing:
  - Login page
  - Registration page
  - Other guest pages (except logout)

## System Architecture

```
User submits form
    ↓
/PETVET/index.php?module=guest&page=register (POST)
    ↓
index.php routes to GuestController::register()
    ↓
GuestController calls RegistrationController::register()
    ↓
RegistrationController:
  - Validates input
  - Extracts user data, roles, role-specific data
  - Handles file uploads (PDFs)
    ↓
RegistrationModel:
  - Creates user in users table
  - Assigns roles in user_roles (all approved)
  - Creates profiles (pet_owner_profiles or service_provider_profiles)
  - Saves documents in role_verification_documents
    ↓
Success: Redirect to login with success message
Error: Redirect back to registration with errors
```

  - Fixed database connection to use `db()` function

### Views

### Routing
- ✅ `index.php` - Added registration handling
  - Added 'register' to guest page routing
  - Added redirect for logged-in users on guest pages

### Legacy Files (Keep for reference)
- `register/multi-step-registration.php` - **DEPRECATED** - Redirects to routing system
- `register/registration_process.php` - **DEPRECATED** - Redirects to routing system
- `register/vet-reg.php` - **DEPRECATED** - Redirects to routing system
- `register/clinic-manager-reg.php` - **DEPRECATED** - Redirects to routing system

**Note:** All old registration URLs now automatically redirect to the new route:
- ❌ Old: `http://localhost/PETVET/register/multi-step-registration.php`
- ✅ New: `http://localhost/PETVET/index.php?module=guest&page=register`

## How to Access

### Registration Page
**URL:** http://localhost/PETVET/index.php?module=guest&page=register

**Features:**
- Multi-step form (Basic Info → Role Selection → Role-Specific Details → Review)
- Multi-role support (select multiple roles)
- File upload for licenses (Trainer, Groomer, Breeder)
- Validation with error messages
- Auto-redirect if already logged in

### After Registration
- User redirected to login page
- All roles auto-approved (no admin verification needed)
- User can login immediately
- Can switch between roles in Settings

## Multi-Role Support

### Supported Roles
1. **Pet Owner** - Creates `pet_owner_profiles` entry
2. **Trainer** - Creates `service_provider_profiles` with role_type='trainer'
3. **Sitter** - Creates `service_provider_profiles` with role_type='sitter'
4. **Breeder** - Creates `service_provider_profiles` with role_type='breeder'
5. **Groomer** - Creates `service_provider_profiles` with role_type='groomer'

### Database Tables Affected
- `users` - User account
- `user_roles` - Role assignments (all with verification_status='approved')
- `pet_owner_profiles` - If pet_owner role selected
- `service_provider_profiles` - If service provider role selected
- `role_verification_documents` - If license files uploaded

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Register with single role (Pet Owner)
- [ ] Register with multiple roles (Trainer + Sitter)
- [ ] Upload PDF files for licenses
- [ ] Verify database entries created correctly
- [ ] Login after registration
- [ ] Switch roles in Settings page
- [ ] Verify first role is set as primary
- [ ] Try accessing registration when already logged in (should redirect)

## Security Features

✅ **Authentication Guards** - Logged-in users can't access registration
✅ **Input Validation** - Email format, password strength, required fields
✅ **Password Hashing** - Using bcrypt
✅ **File Upload Security** - PDF only, 5MB max, unique filenames
✅ **SQL Injection Protection** - Using prepared statements
✅ **Directory Traversal Protection** - File path sanitization
