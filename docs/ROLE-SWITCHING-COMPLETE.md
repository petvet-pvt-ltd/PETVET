# Role Switching Implementation - Complete! âœ…

## What's Been Updated

### 1. **Settings Page - Pet Owner** (`views/pet-owner/settings.php`)
- âœ… Now fetches **actual user roles** from database (not hardcoded)
- âœ… Shows only **approved and active** roles
- âœ… **Current active role is visually marked** with "Active" badge
- âœ… Only displays roles the user actually has

### 2. **Role Switching API** (`api/switch-role.php`)
- âœ… New API endpoint created to handle role switching
- âœ… Validates user is logged in
- âœ… Calls `auth()->switchRole()` to update session
- âœ… Returns redirect URL for the new role
- âœ… Returns error if user doesn't have permission

### 3. **JavaScript Handler** (`public/js/pet-owner/settings.js`)
- âœ… Updated to call the API endpoint
- âœ… Shows loading state while switching
- âœ… Displays success/error messages
- âœ… Redirects to appropriate dashboard after successful switch

## How It Works

### Visual Indication:
- **Current active role** has:
  - Green "Active" badge
  - `active` CSS class applied
  - Radio button pre-checked

### Switching Process:
1. User clicks different role option
2. Clicks "Switch Role" button
3. JavaScript sends API request to `api/switch-role.php`
4. Backend validates and updates session
5. User is redirected to new role's dashboard
6. Sidebar updates to show new role

---

## Test It Now!

### Setup:
You need a user with multiple roles. Let's create one:

**Option 1: Use SQL to add a role to existing user**
```sql
-- Give John Doe (pet owner) the trainer role too
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id, is_primary, is_active, verification_status, verified_at)
VALUES (
    (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'john.doe@example.com'),
    (SELECT id FROM roles WHERE role_name = 'trainer'),
    0, -- Not primary
    1, -- Active
    'approved',
    NOW()
);
```

**Option 2: Register a new account with multiple roles**

### Testing Steps:
1. Login as a user with multiple roles
2. Go to Settings page
3. Look at "Active Role" section
4. Current role should have green "Active" badge âœ…
5. Click on another role
6. Click "Switch Role"
7. You'll be redirected to that role's dashboard
8. Check sidebar - it should show the new role name

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `views/pet-owner/settings.php` - Dynamic role loading
2. âœ… `api/switch-role.php` - New API endpoint
3. âœ… `public/js/pet-owner/settings.js` - API integration

## What's Next (Optional)

### Apply to Other Modules:
The same logic should be applied to:
- [ ] `views/trainer/settings.php`
- [ ] `views/sitter/settings.php`
- [ ] `views/breeder/settings.php`
- [ ] `views/groomer/settings.php`
- [ ] All other role settings pages

They all follow the same pattern, so the update is straightforward.

### Role Management Enhancements:
- [ ] Add "Add New Role" button (to apply for new roles)
- [ ] Show pending roles with "Pending Approval" badge
- [ ] Show rejected roles with reason
- [ ] Allow users to set primary role (default on login)

## Quick Test Query

Run this in phpMyAdmin to give John multiple roles:

```sql
-- Check John's current roles
SELECT u.email, r.role_display_name, ur.is_primary, ur.verification_status
FROM users u
JOIN user_roles ur ON u.id = ur.user_id
JOIN roles r ON ur.role_id = r.id
WHERE u.email = 'john.doe@example.com';

-- Add trainer role to John
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id, is_primary, is_active, verification_status, verified_at)
SELECT 
    u.id,
    (SELECT id FROM roles WHERE role_name = 'trainer'),
    0,
    1,
    'approved',
    NOW()
FROM users u
WHERE u.email = 'john.doe@example.com'
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_roles ur2 
    WHERE ur2.user_id = u.id 
    AND ur2.role_id = (SELECT id FROM roles WHERE role_name = 'trainer')
);

-- Verify
SELECT u.email, r.role_display_name, ur.is_primary, ur.verification_status
FROM users u
JOIN user_roles ur ON u.id = ur.user_id
JOIN roles r ON ur.role_id = r.id
WHERE u.email = 'john.doe@example.com';
```

**Ready to test!** The active role will now be properly highlighted in the settings page! ðŸŽ¯
