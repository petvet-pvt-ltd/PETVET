# Admin Pet Listings Management - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Complete admin review system for pet marketplace listings. Admins can view all pending listings, approve them (making them visible in explore pets), or decline them (permanently deleting them).

## What Was Created

### 1. Backend APIs (api/sell-pet-listings/)
✅ **get-all-listings.php** - Fetches ALL listings (all statuses) with user info, images, and badges
✅ **approve.php** - Changes listing status to 'approved', making it visible in explore pets
✅ **decline.php** - Permanently deletes listing and removes images from server

### 2. Frontend Files

#### views/admin/pet-listings-modern.php
- Modern card-based UI with filters and search
- Stats badges showing pending/approved counts
- Three modals: View Details, Confirm Approve, Confirm Decline
- Eye button to view full details with image carousel
- Approve/Decline buttons (only shown for pending listings)

#### public/css/admin/pet-listings-modern.css
- Responsive grid layout (320px min card width)
- Status badge overlays (pending=yellow, approved=green, rejected=red)
- Modal styling with backdrop blur
- Button styles: approve=green gradient, decline=red gradient
- Loading state and empty state styles

#### public/js/admin/pet-listings-modern.js
- Fetches listings on page load
- Real-time search and filtering (by status, species, search term)
- Updates statistics dynamically
- Image carousel in detail modal
- Approve/decline confirmation with API calls
- Auto-refresh after actions

### 3. Database Integration

#### Updated ExplorePetsModel.php
**Before:** Used hardcoded mock data with 8 fake pets
**After:** Fetches from `sell_pet_listings` table with `status='approved'` filter

Changes:
- `getAllPets()` - Now queries database, joins with users table, fetches images/badges
- `getAllSellers()` - Fetches real user data from users who have approved listings
- Only approved listings appear in explore pets marketplace

### 4. Controller Update
Updated `AdminController.php`:
- Changed `petListings()` method to load `pet-listings-modern` view instead of old demo page

## Complete Workflow

### 1. Pet Owner Creates Listing
- Goes to Explore Pets → "Sell a Pet"
- Fills form with pet details, uploads images (max 3)
- Clicks "Publish Listing"
- **Status: pending** (not visible to public yet)

### 2. Admin Reviews Listing
- Logs in to Admin panel → Pet Listings
- Sees all listings with stats: "X Pending" and "Y Approved"
- Can search, filter by status/species
- Clicks **👁️ View** to see full details with images

### 3. Admin Takes Action

#### Option A: Approve
- Clicks **✓ Approve** button
- Confirmation modal appears
- Clicks "Yes, Approve"
- Status changes to `approved`
- **Listing now appears in Explore Pets** for all users to see

#### Option B: Decline
- Clicks **✗ Decline** button
- Confirmation modal appears
- Clicks "Yes, Decline"
- **Listing permanently deleted** from database
- Images removed from server filesystem
- Card disappears from admin panel

## Database Query Filter
The key change in `ExplorePetsModel.php`:

```php
// Old: return hardcoded array
// New:
$sql = "SELECT ... FROM sell_pet_listings l
        LEFT JOIN users u ON l.user_id = u.id
        WHERE l.status = 'approved'
        ORDER BY l.created_at DESC";
```

This ensures only admin-approved listings show in the public marketplace.
