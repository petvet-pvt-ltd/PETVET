# Pet Owner Pet Profile Management CRUD - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Implemented a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for pet owner pet profile management, following the same pattern as the clinic manager's shop CRUD.

---

## 🗄️ Database Structure

### Table: `pets`
```sql
CREATE TABLE pets (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    species VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    breed VARCHAR(100),
    sex VARCHAR(20),
    date_of_birth DATE,
    weight DECIMAL(10,2),
    color TEXT,
    allergies TEXT,
    notes TEXT,
    photo_url TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_user_id (user_id),
    INDEX idx_is_active (is_active),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

**Features:**
- Soft delete with `is_active` flag
- Foreign key relationship with users table (cascade delete)
- Timestamps for audit trail
- Support for optional fields (breed, sex, DOB, etc.)

---

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Authentication Check:**
   - All API endpoints verify user is logged in
   - Require `pet_owner` role

2. **Ownership Verification:**
   - Update/delete operations verify pet belongs to current user
   - Uses `user_id` in database queries

3. **Input Validation:**
   - Required fields enforced (name, species)
   - File type validation for images
   - File size limit (5MB)
   - SQL injection prevention via prepared statements

4. **File Upload Security:**
   - Allowed types whitelist
   - Unique filename generation
   - Size validation
   - Automatic cleanup on failed operations

---

## 📸 Image Handling

### Upload Directory
`/public/images/pets/`

### Filename Pattern
`pet_{user_id}_{timestamp}_{uniqid}.{extension}`

**Example:** `pet_42_1729612345_6789abcdef.jpg`

### Fallback Images
When no photo uploaded, uses species-specific placeholder:
- Dog → Unsplash dog photo
- Cat → Unsplash cat photo
- Bird → Bing bird photo
- Other species → Default animal photo

## 🔄 CRUD Operation Flow

### CREATE (Add Pet)
1. User clicks "+ Add Pet" button
2. Modal opens with empty form
3. User fills details + uploads photo
4. Click "Save Pet"
5. JS sends POST to `/api/pet-owner/pets/add.php`
6. API validates, saves to DB, uploads image
7. Returns success/error
8. Page reloads to show new pet

### READ (View Pets)
1. Page loads `my-pets.php`
2. Controller calls `MyPetsModel->fetchPets()`
3. Model calls `PetProfileModel->getUserPets()`
4. Returns user's active pets from database
5. PHP renders pet cards

### UPDATE (Edit Pet)
1. User clicks "View Profile" on pet card
2. Modal opens with pre-filled data
3. User edits fields + optionally changes photo
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. JS sends POST to `/api/pet-owner/pets/update.php`
6. API validates, updates DB, handles image
7. Page reloads to show changes

### DELETE (Remove Pet)
1. User hovers over pet card
2. Delete button appears (top-right)
3. User clicks delete button
4. Confirmation dialog opens
5. User confirms deletion
6. JS sends POST to `/api/pet-owner/pets/delete.php`
7. API soft-deletes (sets `is_active = FALSE`)
8. Pet card animates out and removes from UI

## 🎯 Key Differences from Shop CRUD

| Feature | Shop CRUD | Pet CRUD |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **User Scope** | Clinic manager only | Each pet owner sees own pets |
| **Images** | Multiple (up to 5) | Single photo |
| **Image Table** | Separate `product_images` | Single `photo_url` field |
| **Delete Button** | Inside card actions | Top-right corner overlay |
| **Empty State** | Not shown | Friendly "No pets yet" message |
| **Ownership** | No verification needed | Strict user_id verification |

---

## 📝 Future Enhancements

1. **Multiple Photos Per Pet**
   - Create `pet_photos` table
   - Gallery view in profile

2. **Pet Categories/Tags**
   - Custom tags (e.g., "Service Dog", "Indoor Cat")
   - Filter pets by tags

3. **Medical Records Integration**
   - Link to veterinary records
   - Vaccination reminders

4. **Sharing**
   - Share pet profile with vets/groomers
   - Generate shareable pet ID card

5. **Activity Log**
   - Track profile changes
   - Show edit history

---

## 🐛 Known Issues / Notes

1. **Page Reload:** Currently reloads entire page after add/edit. Could be improved with dynamic DOM updates.

2. **Image Preview:** Edit form shows circular preview but upload section removed (cleaner UX).

3. **Soft Delete:** Pets are soft-deleted by default. Hard delete available via `permanent-delete.php` if needed.

4. **Mobile:** Delete button always visible on mobile for better accessibility.

## 📚 Code References

### Following the Pattern
This implementation closely mirrors the clinic manager shop CRUD:
- ✅ Similar model structure (`ProductModel.php` → `PetProfileModel.php`)
- ✅ Similar API endpoints (`api/products/` → `api/pet-owner/pets/`)
- ✅ Similar validation and error handling
- ✅ Similar image upload mechanism
- ✅ Similar soft delete pattern
- ✅ Similar JavaScript fetch patterns

### Differences Explained
- **Ownership checks:** Pets belong to specific users, products don't
- **Single vs multiple images:** Pets use single photo, products use gallery
- **User scope:** Each owner sees only their pets, manager sees all products
