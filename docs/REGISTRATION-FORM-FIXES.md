# Registration Form Fixes - Complete ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed Trainer Hourly Rate Field
**Location:** `views/guest/register.php` - Trainer role section
- **Removed:** `<input type="number" name="trainer_hourly_rate">`
- **Reason:** Not needed during registration
- **Result:** Trainer section now only has: Specialization, Experience, Service Area, Certifications

### 2. ✅ Removed Sitter Maximum Pets Field  
**Location:** `views/guest/register.php` - Sitter role section
- **Removed:** `<input type="number" name="sitter_max_pets">`
- **Reason:** Not needed during registration
- **Result:** Sitter section now has: Daily Rate, Experience, Pet Types, Home Type, Overnight checkbox

### 3. ✅ Fixed Experience Fields - Positive Integers Only, No Decimals
**All experience fields now have:**
- `min="0"` - Only positive numbers
- `step="1"` - No decimal places allowed
- Proper validation

**Fields Updated:**
1. `trainer_experience` - min="0" step="1"
2. `groomer_experience` - min="0" step="1"
3. `sitter_experience` - min="0" step="1"
4. `breeder_experience` - min="0" step="1"

### 4. ✅ Added Debug Logging to Registration Controller
**Location:** `controllers/RegistrationController.php`

**Added comprehensive logging:**
- POST data received
- FILES data received
- Validation results
- User data extraction
- Role extraction
- Role-specific data
- File upload results
- Database operations (user creation, role assignment, profile creation)
- Success/failure tracking
- Exception details with stack trace

### 5. ✅ Fixed File Upload Required Attribute Bug
**Problem:** Browser error "An invalid form control with name='groomer_license' is not focusable"
**Root Cause:** File upload fields marked as `required` were hidden when role not selected

**Files Fixed:**
- `groomer_license` - Removed `required` attribute, changed label to "Optional"
- `breeder_license` - Removed `required` attribute, changed label to "Optional"
- `trainer_license` - Already optional (no change needed)

**Result:** Form now submits successfully without blocking on hidden file inputs

**How to check logs:**
```powershell
# PHP error log
Get-Content C:\xampp\php\logs\php_error_log -Tail 50

# OR Apache error log  
Get-Content C:\xampp\apache\logs\error.log -Tail 50
```

## Form Validation Updates

### Experience Fields Now Validate:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<input type="number" name="trainer_experience" placeholder="Years of Experience" required>

<!-- After -->
<input type="number" name="trainer_experience" placeholder="Years of Experience" min="0" step="1" required>
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Browser prevents negative numbers
- ✅ Browser prevents decimal input (like 2.5 years)
- ✅ Only whole numbers accepted (0, 1, 2, 3...)
- ✅ Better user experience with instant feedback

## Testing Steps

### Test Registration with Debug Logging:

1. **Fill the form** with all 5 roles selected
2. **Complete Registration**
3. **Check error logs** immediately:
   ```powershell
   Get-Content C:\xampp\php\logs\php_error_log -Tail 100
   ```
4. **Look for:**
   - "=== Registration Started ===" 
   - POST data showing all fields
   - Roles extracted (should show: pet_owner, trainer, groomer, sitter, breeder)
   - User created with ID
   - Roles assigned
   - Profiles created
   - "=== Registration Successful ==="

5. **If registration fails**, check logs for:
   - Validation errors
   - Database errors
   - File upload errors
   - Exception messages with stack trace

### Test Experience Field Validation:

1. Try entering **negative number** → Should be blocked
2. Try entering **decimal (2.5)** → Should be blocked  
3. Try entering **0** → Should be accepted
4. Try entering **10** → Should be accepted
5. Leave empty (if not required) → Should be accepted

## Debugging Registration Issues

If "nothing happens" when submitting:

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for JavaScript errors
2. **Check PHP error logs** for server-side errors:
   ```powershell
   Get-Content C:\xampp\php\logs\php_error_log -Tail 100
   ```
3. **Look for the debug output** added to RegistrationController
4. **Check network tab** (F12) to see if POST request was sent
5. **Verify form action** points to correct URL
