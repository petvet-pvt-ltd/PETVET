- Sample service types: Bath & Brush, Full Grooming, Nail Trim, etc.

## Integration Notes

### To integrate with your system:
1. Add Groomer routes to `index.php` router
2. Update sidebar to include Groomer navigation items
3. Connect models to your database
4. Implement actual AJAX endpoints for CRUD operations
5. Add authentication/session checks
6. Update the role switching logic in settings

### Example Route (index.php):
```php
case 'groomer':
    require_once 'controllers/GroomerController.php';
    $controller = new GroomerController();
    switch($action) {
        case 'dashboard': $controller->dashboard(); break;
        case 'services': $controller->services(); break;
        case 'packages': $controller->packages(); break;
        case 'availability': $controller->availability(); break;
        case 'settings': $controller->settings(); break;
        default: $controller->dashboard();
    }
    break;
```
